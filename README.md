# esphome-levoit-core300s
Work in progress for upgrading a Levoit Core 300s air purifier to use esphome local control.  The stock PCB has an ESP32-SOLO-1C with headers broken out to program.  All of the user interface and control seems to be implemented on the U2 MCU.  There is another power PCB that supplies 5V from mains input and connections for the 2.5PM sensor and Motor PWM control.

U2 Pins 13/14 appear to be serial RX/TX connection to the ESP32 GPIO16/17.  Level shifting mosfets on bottom of PCB.  TP10 and TP33 by the ESP32 are respective test points.

Added a wire harness out the top with connections to the J1 header for the ESP32 and to TP10 and TP33.  It looks like 115200 baud serial.  esptool connected to the ESP okay.  115200 8n1 seemed to capture traffic okay.

TODO:

- Decode serial protocol
- Code custom UART esphome interface 
- Investigate OTA of stock hardware without disassembly
- Order a few more 300s for rest of house
